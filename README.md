# Therapeutic-Classification-Prediction-Project

The R markdown and word files are what I submitted for the final project of my Statistical Learning class in college. We went over SL algorithms like: KNN, Penalized Regression, PCA, LOESS, Tree-Based Classifiers/Regressors, SVMs, Neural Networks, etc. All the classic foundational machine learning algorithms. I am just putting this here to show that I know how these algorithms work without going over every single one again in my own project. (I will probably do this later but I don't have time rn)

For this project, I compare the ability of different algorithms predicting the therapeutic classification of certain medications based on the medication's reported side effects. It was a pretty cool project but definitely not my best work overall. So go easy on me lol.
